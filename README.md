# 💫 About Me: Indie Hacker & Product Builder  

Hey! 👋 I’m Katleho — I like building **small internet products** and sharing the journey.  
Right now, I’m exploring how **web, mobile, and AI** can come together to solve real problems.  

🚀 **Web**: Fast, scalable apps with **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind**  
📱 **Mobile**: Smooth cross-platform experiences with **Flutter**  
🤖 **AI & Tools**: Experimenting with **LLMs, LangChain, OpenRouter, FFmpeg** to automate workflows and create new possibilities

## 🎥 Dev Central  
I run **Dev Central**, a YouTube series where developers take on hackathon-style challenges and share their builds.
